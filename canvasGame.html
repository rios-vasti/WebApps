           <p> Use they key W to move up and S to move down. Avoid falling leaves.</p>
            <p> I wanted to add falling leaves and a moving backgound but as you can see it's broken, and the animation of the parrot took way too much time. I do plan on trying to come back to fix it because now I am absesed with it, but for now I guess the parrot can move up and down.</p>
